This project is designed to classify EEG signals using a convolutional neural network (CNN). The program uses the PyTorch library to train the model on data recorded in EDF files. The model is trained on signal segments that are filtered, normalized, and split into parts of a specified length. Classification is performed based on the labels specified in the CSV file.

## üåü Key Features

- **Data Loading**: Support for EDF files (extension must be in uppercase, e.g., `.EDF`).
- **Preprocessing**:
  - Signal filtering (lower and upper thresholds).
  - Amplitude normalization.
  - Splitting into segments of a specified length.
- **Model Training**: Using CNN to classify EEG segments.
- **Prediction**: Classifying new data using the trained model.
- **GPU support**: Ability to use a graphics card to speed up training (requires PyTorch with CUDA support).

## üíª Requirements

1. **Data**:
   - EDF files with EEG signals.
   - CSV file with class labels. Format:
     ```
     Filename,key
     file1.EDF,1
     file2.EDF,2
     ```
     - `Filename`: Full file name (case sensitive).
     - `key`: Classification code (number).

2. **Environment**:
   - Python 3.8 or higher.
   - Installed dependencies (see `requirements.txt`).

3. **Hardware**:
   - For GPU use: CUDA-capable graphics card (recommended).

     - Reads EDF files.
     - Filters and normalizes signals.
     - Splits into segments.
     - Forms tensors for training.

3. **`model.py`**:
   - Implements CNN for EEG classification.
   - Model architecture:
     - Convolutional layers.
     - Fully connected layers.
     - Function for calculating the size of input data.

4. **`trainer.py`**:
   - Trains the model:
     - Splits the data into training and testing sets.
     - Sets up the optimizer and loss function.
     - Logs the training process.
   - Evaluates the model:

   - Processes EDF files:
     - Segments them.
     - Classifies using the trained model.
     - Outputs results in tabular format.

6. **`ui.py`**:
   - Provides graphical user interface (GUI):
     - Buttons for loading data, training, prediction.
     - Displays status and progress.
     - Visualizes training results (loss and accuracy graphs).

7. **`controller.py`**:
   - Manages application logic:
     - Interacts between the GUI and other modules.
     - Uses multithreading for long-running operations (data loading, training, prediction).

8. **`EEGApp.py`**:
   - Acts as the application's entry point.
   - Initializes the GUI and controller.
